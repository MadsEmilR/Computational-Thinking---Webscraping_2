# Session 7: Webscraping
In this session, you will learn the most important things you need to know about webscraping in Python using hidden APIs. Please solve the following tasks in the files ***task1.py*** and ***task2.py***.

## Task 1: Scraping Movie Data
Write a Python script to scrape the names as well as all the additional information on the movies listed on the website http://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/ajax-javascript/. Note that the website uses AJAX requests and you have to use the network tab of your browser to find the hidden API.

## Task 2: Crpyto Prices
The website https://coinmarketcap.com/ lists the prices of over 20.000 crypto currencies. Your task is to scrape the current prices of as many cryptos as possible using the hidden API. Note that you might have to send multiple requests with slides modifications to get all the data.

## Task 3: House Prices
The website https://www.boligportal.dk/ lists housing opportunities in Denmark. Your task is to build a webscraper that collects data from this site for at least 100 houses. If you finish that task, you can try to figure out how to also include search criteria (e.g., the name of a city) into your scraper. Store the data in a list of settings and print some basic informations to the user (e.g., number of available listings)
